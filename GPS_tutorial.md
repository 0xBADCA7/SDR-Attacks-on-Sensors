# GPS Tutorial: Scheme and spoofing

Jianqiu Cao

## GPS Introduction

GPS consists of three segments - the satellite segment (**satellite constellation**), the ground segment (**ground control network**), and the user segment (**user equipment**). See Figure 1 below.

The **satellite constellation** comprises satellites in low earth orbit that provide the ranging signals and navigation data messages to user equipment. 

The **ground control network** tracks and maintains the satellite constellation by monitoring satellite health and signal integrity and maintaining the satellite orbital configuration. Furthermore, the ground control network also updates the *satellite clock corrections* and *ephemerides* as well as numerous other parameters essential to determining user position,velocity, and time (PVT). 

The **user equipment** receives signals from the satellite constellation and computes user PVT. [^3]

## Attacks

**GPS Simulator Attacks**[^1]

* Generate fake ephemeris data which includes spoofing location.

* Transmit signal using SDR(Software Defined Radio) platforms.

  â€‹


**C/A Code Spoofing Attack**[^2]

* Does not change the navigation message, but rather tampers with the pseudorange between the satellite and receiver. 
* The spoofer estimates the position and velocity of the victim thru radar and transmits an artificial seamless signal that conveys spoofing C/A code.
