## Attacks

**GPS Simulator Attacks **[^1]

* Generate fake ephemeris data which includes spoofing location.

* Transmit signal using SDR(Software Defined Radio) platforms.

  â€‹


**C/A Code Spoofing Attack**[^2]

* Does not change the navigation message, but rather tampers with the pseudorange between the satellite and receiver. 
* The spoofer estimates the position and velocity of the victim thru radar and transmits an artificial seamless signal that conveys spoofing C/A code.
